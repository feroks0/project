Code will be executed with main.py file or exe file can be used. 

I used an UV sensor and ESP32. To collect the data, i used micropython in Thonny. 

Micropython code that i used for data collecting and saving is named as logger.py and exist in the Project file. 

There is an example data set named as uvdata.csv in the Project file. For testing the Project, the user needs to upload this file in interface of application.
